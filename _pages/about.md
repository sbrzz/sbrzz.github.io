This blog is my space to explore and discuss AI. Not just the technical side, but also its intersection with governance, geopolitics, and market dynamics.

Why "Gradients Zone"?

AI is shaping our world, and I believe these conversations matter now more than ever.

The Blog Rules:

✅ Short reads (less than 5 minutes).

✅ 100% human-generated content—no AI in the writing process.

I hope you'll find it insightful!
