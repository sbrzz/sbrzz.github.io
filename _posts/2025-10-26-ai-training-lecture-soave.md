On Saturday, October 25th, 2025, I had the pleasure of giving a training lecture on AI in Soave (Verona, Italy), in collaboration with the local municipality.

The lecture titled "Artificial Intelligence: risks and opportunities" was based on the [same presentation][mv] held in Montebello Vicentino.

Participants (approximately 30 people) were distributed among all age groups.

One take away from this event is the desire and the urgency of people in old age to not be unprepared when faced with this technology.

At the end of the event, I was honored to receive a bottle of a "Lessini Durello 733 Brut" as a gift from the organizers.

Some pics of the event.
