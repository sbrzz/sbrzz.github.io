Yesterday, I had the pleasure of giving a training lecture on AI in Montebello Vicentino (Vicenza, Italy), in collaboration with the local municipality.

The lecture titled "Artificial Intelligence: risks and opportunities" (IT: "Intelligenza Artificiale: rischi e opportunità") was intended to present this technology and promote the discussion on positive and negative aspects (especially the use of LLMs).

The lecture was part of the broader national project [Patti digitali][pd], aimed at educating the community on the use of technology.

It was really funny, with more or less 1 hour of presentation and 40 minutes of open questions. Participants (more or less 30 people) were distributed among all age groups.

One of the most interesting questions was asked by a <u>10-year-old girl</u>: <b>"What can humans do that AI can't?"</b>.

Some pics of the event.
