I'm happy to share the second post in the series <b>AI Across Borders</b>.

This series aims to feature ideas and experiences in AI from professionals, researchers, engineers, and practitioners around the world.

Our second guest and the first Woman in AI featured is [Meena Chand][meena]. Originally from Nepal, Meena moved to the UK, where she studied at the University of Wolverhampton.

With experience in international inclusive and support programs, she’s recently begun her journey in AI, and we're excited to hear her perspective.

Over to you, Meena!

## Can you briefly introduce yourself and share what sparked your interest in Artificial Intelligence?

Hi, I’m Meena Chand. I completed my MSc in Computer Science from the University of  Wolverhampton. My interest in AI began when I saw how technologies like chatbots, facial recognition, and recommendation systems could make life easier. I was fascinated by how machines could understand human language and behaviour, and that inspired me to explore how AI can solve real-world problems.

## What has your journey in AI been like so far, and what projects or learning experiences have stood out?

My journey has been exciting and full of learning. One major milestone was participating in the IBM watsonx.ai Hackathon. My team built an "AI Minute System" that could automatically summarize meeting notes using Watson AI models. It was my first real experience applying AI to a practical problem, and it showed me the power of automation in professional settings.

I also attended a hands-on AI training session where we explored advanced topics like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Conditional GANs (CGANs), and LLAMA models. We used real-world datasets and learned how these AI techniques can improve areas like road safety and smart transport planning. The session ended with certificates for all participants, and I walked away with a deeper understanding of how Generative AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered LLMs can create practical solutions.


## Do you feel the UK offers a strong foundation for building a career in AI? Would you consider relocating to other countries for broader opportunities or experiences?

Yes, I think the UK is a great place to start a career in AI. There are many academic programs, tech events, and innovation hubs across the country. Universities here support hands-on learning, and companies are open to hiring fresh graduates for AI roles. That said, I’m also open to relocating if it means gaining broader experience or working on global AI projects. Learning from diverse cultures and work environments can only make us better professionals.

## As a woman in AI, have you encountered any challenges or noticed gaps in opportunities? What changes would you like to see to support more women entering the field?

Yes, being a woman in tech, especially in AI, sometimes feels like being in a minority. There are fewer female role models and fewer networking spaces tailored to women. I’d love to see more mentorship programs, scholarships, and women-led AI workshops. Creating more safe, inclusive, and supportive environments would definitely encourage more girls and women to pursue AI confidently and grow their careers.


## Coming from Nepal and now engaging with AI in the UK, how would you compare the tech landscape between the two countries in terms of opportunities, innovation, and support for young talent?

Nepal has a growing tech ecosystem and a lot of talented people. But in the UK, I found that there’s more structure—like well-funded research, government support for innovation, and strong links between universities and industry. There are also more internship opportunities and events like hackathons and workshops where students can directly work with AI tools. Both countries are doing well, but the UK provides a smoother path for young talent to explore and build in the AI space.

## Based on your experience supporting inclusivity as International Student Life Digital Ambassador at University of Wolverhampton, how do you see AI contributing to more inclusive communities?

During my time as a Digital Ambassador, I worked on making university life more inclusive for international students through digital tools and online support. I see AI as a powerful tool to support this mission. For example, AI can help break language barriers with real-time translation, support neurodiverse students with personalized learning tools, and assist disabled students through voice recognition and image-to-text technology. If designed responsibly, AI can create equal access to information, services, and opportunities for everyone, no matter their background or ability.
